# AI Prompts - Operations

## üìã Overview

This directory contains AI context prompts specifically designed for **operations work** on the BuildingOS platform. These prompts provide comprehensive context for AI assistants when working on monitoring, incident response, deployment management, and production operations using Sprint-based methodology.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE AWARENESS**

**MANDATORY:** Before starting any operations work, AI assistants MUST:

1. **Find the Main Documentation Index:** Always start by reading `docs/README.md` - this is the **main documentation index** that contains the complete project structure and navigation guide.

2. **Understand Documentation Tree:** Review `docs/documentation-tree.md` for the complete project structure overview and quick navigation paths.

3. **Locate Relevant Documents:** Use the documentation structure to find the specific documents you need for your task.

### **Documentation Navigation Strategy:**
- **Start Here:** `docs/README.md` - Main documentation index
- **Structure Overview:** `docs/documentation-tree.md` - Complete project structure
- **Operations Focus:** `docs/04-operations/README.md` - Operations-specific documentation
- **Monitoring Strategy:** `docs/04-operations/01-monitoring-strategy/README.md` - Monitoring and alerting system
- **Development Reference:** `docs/03-development/README.md` - Development status and current sprint
- **Architecture Reference:** `docs/02-architecture/README.md` - System architecture

### **Quick Documentation Paths:**
- **For Monitoring Issues:** `docs/04-operations/01-monitoring-strategy/README.md` ‚Üí `docs/04-operations/02-runbook-template/runbook-template.md`
- **For Incident Response:** `docs/04-operations/03-post-mortem-template/post-mortem-template.md` ‚Üí `docs/04-operations/99-lessons/README.md`
- **For Deployment Support:** `docs/03-development/01-project-management/current-sprint.md` ‚Üí `docs/03-development/05-deployment-guide/README.md`
- **For Infrastructure Issues:** `docs/04-operations/terraform-best-practices-checklist.md` ‚Üí `docs/04-operations/terraform-refactoring-guide.md`
