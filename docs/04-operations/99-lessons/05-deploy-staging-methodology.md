# Lesson: Deploy Staging Methodology for Complex Changes

## Context

During resolution of complex Terraform dependency issues, a staged deployment approach was crucial for breaking down interdependent resources and ensuring successful infrastructure deployment.

## Lesson Learned

Complex infrastructure changes with multiple interdependencies require incremental deployment strategies. The approach of "altering the main code in stages" allows for isolation of issues, incremental validation, and safer rollback procedures when dealing with circular dependencies or complex resource relationships.

## Suggested Action

For complex infrastructure deployments:
1. **Map dependencies** before attempting deployment
2. **Identify blocking resources** that prevent parallel creation
3. **Create staging strategy** with logical separation of concerns
4. **Deploy incrementally** validating each stage before proceeding
5. **Maintain rollback capability** at each stage

Example staging process:
- Stage 1: Deploy base infrastructure (networks, databases)
- Stage 2: Deploy compute resources (Lambda functions)  
- Stage 3: Deploy integrations (IAM policies, permissions)
- Stage 4: Final validation and testing

This methodology reduces blast radius and enables faster problem resolution when issues arise.
