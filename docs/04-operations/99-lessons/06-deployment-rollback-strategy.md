# Deployment Rollback Strategy

## Lesson

The lack of a clear rollback strategy caused extended downtime during our last failed deployment.

## Context

When the new payment processing service failed in production, the team had no documented process for quick recovery.

## Suggested Action

Document and test an automated rollback procedure for all critical services before the next deployment.
