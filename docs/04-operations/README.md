## 📊 **Monitoring System**

**Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system implemented:**

### **Key Components**
- **CloudWatch Dashboards** - Real-time metrics visualization
- **CloudWatch Alarms** - Automated alerting system (P1, P2, P3)
- **SNS Notifications** - Centralized alert distribution
- **Performance Monitoring** - Optimization and cost management

### **Quick Access**
- **Main Dashboard**: `bos-dev-monitoring`
- **Performance Dashboard**: `bos-dev-performance`
- **Alert Topic**: `bos-dev-alerts`

### **Critical Alarms**
- **P1 (Critical)**: Lambda errors, API Gateway errors, DynamoDB throttling
- **P2 (Warning)**: High latency, error rates, performance issues
- **P3 (Info)**: High traffic, usage patterns
