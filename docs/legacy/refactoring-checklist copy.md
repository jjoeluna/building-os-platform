# DEPRECATED: Clean Infrastructure Rebuild Checklist: BuildingOS Platform

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS DOCUMENT IS DEPRECATED ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Replacement:** This checklist has been replaced by the principle-driven backlog system:
- **New System:** [Development Backlog](../03-development/01-project-management/backlog.md) - Single source of truth
- **Methodology:** [Refactoring Principles](../03-development/01-project-management/refactoring-principles.md) - 9 fundamental principles
- **Completed Work:** [Completed Work](../03-development/01-project-management/completed.md) - Historical record

**Date Deprecated:** 2025-01-11  
**Reason:** Replaced by more efficient principle-driven approach that eliminates duplication between checklist and backlog
