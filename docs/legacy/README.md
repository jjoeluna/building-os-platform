# üìö Legacy Documentation

This directory contains documentation that was moved from the canonical structure defined in `docs/README.md`.

## Why This Directory Exists

The BuildingOS documentation follows a strict structure defined in `docs/README.md`:
- `00-business-context/` - Business context and campaign briefs
- `01-project-vision/` - Project charter and requirements  
- `02-architecture/` - System design and technical decisions
- `03-development/` - Development tools and implementation status
- `04-operations/` - Production maintenance and operations

## Moved Items

### Directories Moved

## Lessons Reorganization

**Lessons have been reorganized by domain:**
- **Architecture Lessons:** `docs/02-architecture/lessons/` - API and system architecture lessons
- **Development Lessons:** `docs/03-development/lessons/` - Python, testing, and environment lessons  
- **Operations Lessons:** `docs/04-operations/04-lessons/` - Infrastructure, deployment, and operations lessons

## Migration Notes

- **Date**: August 7, 2025
- **Reason**: Align with canonical documentation structure
- **Impact**: No functional changes, only organizational
- **Next Steps**: Review and potentially delete empty files, archive old questionnaires

## Recovery

If you need to access any of these files, they are preserved here. Consider:
1. Moving relevant content to canonical locations
2. Updating references in other documents
3. Deleting truly obsolete files
