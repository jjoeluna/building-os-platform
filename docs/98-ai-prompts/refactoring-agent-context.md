## üìä **PROJECT MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION**

### **üîÑ Continuous Updates Required**
As you execute each principle, you MUST update project management files:

#### **üìà Current Sprint Updates:**
- **File:** `docs/03-development/01-project-management/current-sprint.md`
- **Frequency:** After completing each principle
- **Content:** Mark principle completion with timestamps and notes
- **Format:** Update the principle completion checklist

#### **üìã Backlog Status:**
- **File:** `docs/03-development/01-project-management/backlog.md`
- **Frequency:** When epic status changes
- **Content:** Update epic status (In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Completed)
- **Dependencies:** Update dependency status for downstream epics

#### **‚úÖ Completed Work Tracking:**
- **File:** `docs/03-development/01-project-management/completed.md`
- **Frequency:** When epic is fully completed
- **Content:** Add comprehensive completion record with:
  - All principle completion details
  - Quality metrics achieved
  - Lessons learned and best practices
  - Technical achievements and improvements

#### **üìä Metrics Updates:**
- **File:** `docs/03-development/01-project-management/metrics.md`
- **Frequency:** Weekly or at epic completion
