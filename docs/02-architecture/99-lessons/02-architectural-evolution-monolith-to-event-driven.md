# Lesson: Architectural Evolution from Monolith to Event-Driven

## Context

The BuildingOS project underwent a revolutionary architectural transformation from a centralized, stateful coordinator to a distributed, event-driven system with specialized agents communicating through SNS topics.

## Lesson Learned

Event-driven architectures with stateless components provide superior scalability, resilience, and maintainability compared to centralized systems. The transformation from `API Gateway → Director → Coordinator → Tools` to `API Gateway → Director → SNS Topics → Independent Agents` resulted in a more robust and flexible system.

## Suggested Action

For complex systems requiring scalability:
1. **Design for events** rather than direct calls between components
2. **Make components stateless** with external state management (DynamoDB)
3. **Specialize agents** for specific domains rather than monolithic services
4. **Use message queues** (SNS/SQS) for loose coupling
5. **Implement persistent state** management independent of compute

This architecture enables independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance of each component while maintaining system coherence through well-defined events.
