  *Third-Party API Limitations Can Force Critical Architectural Changes*  
  📅 2025-08-04 | 🏷️ API, Architecture, Documentation

### System Architecture Evolution
- **[02-architectural-evolution-monolith-to-event-driven.md](02-architectural-evolution-monolith-to-event-driven.md)**  
  *Architectural Evolution from Monolith to Event-Driven*  
  📅 2025-08-05 | 🏷️ Architecture, Event-Driven, Stateless

## 🎯 Key Themes

### **Architectural Pivots**
- External API limitations can force fundamental architectural changes
- Event-driven architectures provide superior scalability and resilience
- Stateless components with external state management enable better scaling

### **Design Principles**
- Validate critical dependencies with PoCs before finalizing architecture
- Design for events rather than direct component calls
- Specialize agents for specific domains rather than monolithic services

## 📊 Impact

These lessons directly influenced:
- Migration from Notion to Docs-as-Code approach
- Transformation to distributed, event-driven architecture
- Adoption of SNS/SQS for loose coupling
- Implementation of specialized agents
