## 🎯 Key Themes

### **Python Best Practices**
- Proper dependency management is critical for Lambda functions
- Virtual environment discipline prevents dependency conflicts
- Consistent Python versions across environments

### **Development Workflow**
- Incremental validation beats big-bang debugging approaches
- Local environment must accurately mirror production
- Environment consistency prevents "works on my machine" issues

### **Quality Assurance**
- Test incrementally rather than waiting for complete features
- Validate assumptions early in the development cycle
- Maintain environment parity across development stages

## 📊 Impact

These lessons directly influenced:
- Standardized Python dependency management procedures
- Virtual environment setup guidelines
- Incremental testing and validation workflows
- Environment consistency requirements
