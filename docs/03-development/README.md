## 🎯 **Current Focus**

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **🔧 Complete API Gateway Handlers** - PSIM and Coordinator agents
2. **🌟 Implement Multi-Agent Chat** - Core platform functionality
3. **👥 Multi-Tenant Conversations** - RESTful conversation management

**Development Workflow:**
1. Check `01-development-status.md` for current priorities
2. Update `02-architecture/02-api-contract.md` before implementing
3. Use CLI commands from `02-cli-commands-reference.md`
4. Test incrementally and update status

## 🧠 **AI Assistant Integration**

**For Development Sessions:** Use `03-developer-context-prompt.md`  
**For Architecture Sessions:** Use `04-architect-context-prompt.md`

Both prompts reference authority documents and provide consistent context for AI-assisted development.
