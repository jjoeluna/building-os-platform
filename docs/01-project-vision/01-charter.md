# Project Charter: BuildingOS

## 1. Problem Statement

The management of modern buildings, especially those with mixed-use (residential and short-term rentals), suffers from **operational fragmentation and inefficiency**. Critical functionalities such as access control, user communication, maintenance, and financial management operate in isolated systems and manual processes. This results in:
*   **High Operational Load:** Building managers and field teams are overloaded with repetitive tasks, acting as human routers for information flows.
*   **Frustrating User Experience:** Residents, guests, and owners must navigate multiple channels and disconnected processes to handle simple tasks.
*   **Lack of Visibility and Data:** The absence of a centralized system prevents data-driven strategic decision-making and the optimization of building operations.

## 2. Vision & Objectives

### Vision

To establish BuildingOS as the **standard operating brain for intelligent buildings**, transforming today's reactive management into a proactive, automated, and user-centric ecosystem that enhances efficiency, security, and the living/working experience.

### Business Objectives

1.  **Optimize Operations:** Reduce the time spent by building staff on manual and repetitive tasks by 40%.
2.  **Elevate User Experience:** Increase resident and guest satisfaction, reflected by a 20-point increase in the Net Promoter Score (NPS).
3.  **Create a Scalable Business Model:** Structure BuildingOS as a robust SaaS (Software as a Service) platform, ready to be marketed by partner companies to hundreds of properties.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

The MVP is focused on validating the system's backbone: **integrated identity and access**.
1.  **Conversational Interface:** A chat-based entry point for all user requests.
2.  **ERP Synchronization (Superlógica):** Establish the source of truth for long-term residents.
3.  **Access Provisioning (PSIM Situator):** Automate basic physical access for synchronized users.
4.  **Elevator Interaction (Neomot):** Allow users to call the elevator via chat.

### In Scope (Final Vision)

The final product vision includes all modules detailed in the requirements gathering:
*   Complete hospitality management (broker integration, guest journey).
*   Proactive operations (automatic elevator calls).
*   Intelligent and predictive maintenance.
*   Integrated security (visibility for staff, dynamic profiles).
*   Modules for utility metering, communication, reservations, and financials.
*   A platform for partners.

### Out of Scope (Final Vision)

Even in the final vision, the following items are **explicitly out of scope** to maintain product focus:
*   **Proprietary Hardware:** BuildingOS will always be a software platform that integrates with third-party hardware. We will not manufacture cameras, locks, or sensors.
*   **Accounting Software:** We will not be an ERP. We integrate with market ERPs (like Superlógica) but will not process the building's accounting.
*   **Personnel Management:** The system will not include HR functionalities like payroll or time tracking for building employees.
*   **Social Network:** While it facilitates communication, BuildingOS is not intended to be a social network for residents.
